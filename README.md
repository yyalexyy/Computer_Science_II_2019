# This is a Java Algorithms Code Sample - CSII
### - Assignment 1 (GUI, Expetion Handling, Reading Files)
  - The program uses a GUI interface to interact with user.
  - Checks the validity of one password, the strength of the password, and gives feedback about the password that was entered.
  - Saves the illegal passwords in a text file in the format of \<password>\<space>\<message of exception thrown>.
  
### - Assignment 2 (Stacks and Queues)
  - Created a generic queue and stack class that simulate delivering packages from the container of packages by the volunteers to recipients.
  
### - Assignment 3 (Doubly Linked Lists)
  - Created a generic doubly-linked list class with an iterator and a generic sorted doubly-linked list class with an iterator that inherits from your generic doubly-linked class. 
  
### - Assignment 4 (Concordance)
  - A program that creates a concordance from some text. It will list all the words in alphabetic order followed by a list of line numbers where the word can be found in the text.
  - The program uses a GUI interface to interact with user. It either reads input from a string and returns an ArrayList of strings that represent the concordance of the string or it reads a data file and generates the concordance data written to an output file. 
  - Program implemented a hash table with buckets.
  
### - Assignment 5 (Binary Tree)
  - This program converts Morse Code to English with either user inputting the Morse Code or reading from a data file.
  - Also created a 4 levels binary tree (MoresCodeTree).
  
### - Assignment 6 (Graph)
  - Created a TownGraph class that stores the graph by using sets. For the Graph <V,E>,  V is the vertex type (a Town), E is the edge type (a Road).
  - The program uses a GUI interface to interact with user.
  - The program can also load data from text file in the format of "road-name,miles;town-name; town-name".
  - The program uses Dijkstra shortest path to find the shortest path from the source to every other vertex in the graph.
